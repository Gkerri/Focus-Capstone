                <div class="my-experience">
                    <p>I have enjoyed taking this class and getting to know my classmates. It was good to see some familiar faces from Foundations as well as meeting new people. I enjoy learning new skills. The more I learn about coding, the more I like it.</p>

                <div class="my-challenge">
                    <p>One of my challenges has been grasping the difference between box-models and positioning, and knowing when to use each. The more I do either, the better I get at it. Admittedly, I don't use positioning as much as flex-box.<br>My most challenging assignment has been this capstone. Part of that challenge has been choosing the subject of my project. The other part has been choosing how to write the code.<br>I watched many tutorials and asked google a lot of questions. I didn't want to copy code from any website or youtube, so it was tricky but also fun finding a balance between watching tutorials and finding my way through trial and error. It is very satisfying to see my programming work as it should.</p>

                    <p>Now that we are done, I am looking at the Grow with Google Coursera courses. I'm looking at IT Support, AI, and UX Design.</p>
